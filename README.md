# Roblox Group Sale Notifier

This script monitors the sales of a specified Roblox group and sends updates to a Discord webhook. It runs at a regular interval and checks the group's sales and revenue details.


## Obtaining the Roblox Token

If you're running the script on a **VPS or a panel** where you cannot directly log in through the browser, you may need to connect to a VPN to obtain your Roblox session token.

### Optional: Steps to obtain your Roblox token using a VPN:

1. **Connect to a VPN**: If you are using the script on a VPS or panel, connect to the VPN of the country where your Roblox account is located. This step is optional but may be necessary in some cases.
2. **Login to Roblox**: While connected to the VPN, log in to Roblox via a browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox).
3. **Obtain the Roblox Token**:
    - After logging in, open the browserâ€™s Developer Tools (usually with `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
    - Go to the **Application** tab.
    - In the left sidebar, under **Storage**, select **Cookies**.
    - Find the `ROBLOSECURITY` cookie in the list of cookies.
    - Copy the value of the `ROBLOSECURITY` cookie. This is your Roblox session token.
4. Paste the token into the `config.json` file under the `ROBLOX_TOKEN` field.

### Note: Using a VPN is optional, and only necessary if you face issues accessing Roblox while running the script on a VPS or panel.
